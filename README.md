DistributedFileSystem
=====================

Lab project of distributed systems, fct-unl 2013/14. The project's goal was to have distributed file servers, which coulb be synchronzied whenever a client requested that op. Also, there is also a proxy for the dropbox, and google drive file system. Because I have not implemented the google drive file system, i wont publish it. And also it has very special properties like, it allows to have multiple files with the same name, which is not possible under an usual file system.
