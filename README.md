DistributedFileSystem
=====================

Lab project of distributed systems, fct-unl 2013/14. The project's goal was to have distributed file servers, which coulb be synchronzied whenever a client requested that op. Also, there is also a proxy for the dropbox, and google drive file system. Because I have not implemented the google drive file system, i wont publish it. And also it has very special properties like, it allows to have multiple files with the same name, which is not possible under an usual file system.





Next goals of this project is to hava a fully reliable synchronization command, and also to have suppor to fuse.
